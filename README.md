Schedulded Messaging
====================

This is repository for blog post http://przybyszd.blogspot.com/2015/12/scheduling-tasks-using-message-queue.html

To run examples you have to intall `docker` and `docker-compose` first, beacause ActiveMQ nad RabbitMQ are docker containers here.

1.	`docker-compose up -d`
2.	`./gradlew clean test`
